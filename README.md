# UOOutlands

![Alt text](banner.jpg?raw=true "Title")

UOSteam client scripts for use with Ultima Online Outlands server. These are public scripts you are welcome to use and share. Please check back frequently for updates. I have written *most* of these scripts myself, but occasionally I will find a good script someone else wrote and add it in. If you would like me to host one of your scripts, send it to me.

Script contributions can be sent to my discord account **Jewele**

## Need help

Im here to help and I will as time permits (I like to play too). But I've been writing UO Steam scripts for years - and I'd love to help you with a problem you are having! Just hit me up - no charge, really!

## Whats New?

Latest scripts I've published you might like:

| Script | Purpose|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| :mag:  | Vendor mall searcher! Yah! This is a fun one I just wrote. Saves time looking for those special items at big vendor malls. Enjoy and I do appreciate constructive feedback. [here](Utility/VendorMall.txt)
| :snake:  | Just finished a poison training macro that uses Storage Shelves. [here](Skills/Poisoning_Shelf (55-120).txt)


## Secret Scripts

I have several personal scripts available, you can now purchase from me, for 5 Prevalia donation coins (each). The charged cost represents the amount of time I have spent writing, testing, and perfecting them. The cost also covers helping you - these are much more complicated scripts (500+ lines) and *everyone* has questions about getting them going or customizing them to their needs.

| Script | Purpose|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| :shipit: Recall Farmer  | Need to level your aspect? Level pets? Whaaaaaat!!? Without touching your keyboard!? Yep I did it. 700 line monster script to recall you overworld and level your pets/aspect. Detects special loot, detects Pks, keeps pets healed, dumps loot, the list of features is insane! Audible sound on damage, and 60 second alarm reminder to look at screen (for GMs). Took me 3 weeks to perfect this. Yours for 10! Prev Coins (and refundable as is everything). PM me for more details. Video preview of script running available on request (PM me). Requires taming/archery. |
| :moyai: Recall Miner  | Its back!! The insanely successful recall miner (this isnt just a single spot mining btw). I also send you a guide on how to mark spots. Made insane amounts of ingots for my friends and myself with this one.  Ran this myself or a week straight, next week I made a 120 Blacksmith and 120 Tinker. Sick ingots and near-PK proof to boot. I love this one. Watch it in action at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce5CWOk2Il0. You can view the script development log and notes [here](Gathering/UOO_Recall_Miner.txt). Folks who have bought it from me really appreciate it :) and seem to have zero issues while making lots of ingots! |
| :evergreen_tree: Recall Lumberjack  | Hands down, the script I am *most* proud of and the one I have only shared with the closest friends. Everyone which has tried it had one word to describe it - 'amazing'. Given the semi-random layout of UOO trees, I wrote a special 'random' algorithm to match it. You can view the script development log and notes [here](Gathering/UOO_Recall_LumberJack.txt). Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr9wf8KUiYI  |
| :ship: Pirate Scripts  | You get (3) of my pirate scripts which automate popular builds. These taunt, throw explodes, heal your crew, cure, drink heal pots, and so much more. Only shared with my close pirate buddies, who love them! I run 3 accounts on a ship all automated, I barely have to do anything but fire the cannons and move around! |
| :moneybag: Vendor Scam | Check every item (drops, scrolls, bags, chests) on a vendor to see if somebody accidentally priced it at 999! Run at vendor malls ~ this is a fun one. I give this to you free if you buy any other scripts. It wasn't that hard to write and but I also don't want to just pass it out to everyone.|

By purchasing a script from me, you get:
* My (instant) response any time I am on to help you with them.
* My help customizing it to your needs and any time you require to get it going.
* Full refund of donation coins if you simply don't like it. Maybe it didn't work out the way you liked, or wasn't what you expected. No problem. I'm happy to give coins back if you promise me you wont use it :)

Why sell them? 
* They took an immense amount time to create and test. Time I could have spent in game in farming. If I give them away, then its a double whammie - not only have I missed farming, but I've given you scripts to compete with my ability to sell ingots/lumber. See? Asking for a few donation coins offsets this risk and lost time/revenue.

My expectation is, you are going to get use out of them. If, for some reason, like some crazy game rule change - the scripts no longer can work - you will instantly get back your coins. Or, you decide to leave server, and want to get back coins to give to a friend, no problem! If you don't get the value you want, I want to refund you!!!
