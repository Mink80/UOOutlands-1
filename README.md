# UOOutlands

![Alt text](banner.jpg?raw=true "Title")

UOSteam client scripts for use with Ultima Online Outlands server. These are public scripts you are welcome to use and share. Please check back frequently for updates. I have written *most* of these scripts myself, but occasionally I will find a good script someone else wrote and add it in. If you would like me to host one of your scripts, send it to me.

Script contributions can be sent to my discord account **Jewele**

## Need help

Im here to help and I will as time permits (I like to play too). But I've been writing UO Steam scripts for years - and I'd love to help you with a problem you are having! Just hit me up - no charge, really!

## Secret Scripts

I have several personal scripts available, you can now purchase from me, for 5 Prevalia donation coins (each). The charged cost represents the amount of time I have spent writing, testing, and perfecting them. 

| Script | Purpose|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| :moyai: Recall Miner  | Its back!! The insanely successful recall miner (this isnt just a single spot mining btw). I also send you a guide on how to mark spots. Made insane amounts of ingots for my friends and myself with this one.  Ran this myself or a week straight, next week I made a 120 Blacksmith and 120 Tinker. Sick ingots and near-PK proof to boot. I love this one. Watch it in action at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce5CWOk2Il0 |
| :evergreen_tree: Recall Lumberjack  | Hands down, the script I am *most* proud of and the one I have only shared with the closest friends. Everyone which has tried it had one word to describe it - 'amazing'  |
| :ship: Pirate Scripts  | You get (3) of my pirate scripts which automate popular builds. These taunt, throw explodes, heal your crew, cure, drink heal pots, and so much more. Only shared with my close pirate buddies, who love them! I run 3 accounts on a ship all automated, I barely have to do anything but fire the cannons and move around! |
| :moneybag: Vendor Scam | Check every item (drops, scrolls, bags, chests) on a vendor to see if somebody accidentally priced it at 999! Run at vendor malls ~ this is a fun one.|

By purchasing a script from me, you get:
* My (instant) response any time I am on to help you with them.
* My help customizing it to your needs and any time you require to get it going.
* Full refund of donation coins if you simply don't like it. Maybe it didn't work out the way you liked, or wasn't what you expected. No problem. I'm happy to give coins back if you promise me you wont use it :)

Why sell them? 
* They took an immense amount time to create and test. Time I could have spent in game in farming. If I give them away, then its a double whammie - not only have I missed farming, but I've given you scripts to compete with my ability to sell ingots/lumber. See? Asking for a few donation coins offsets this risk and lost time/revenue.
