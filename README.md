## Secret Scripts

I have several personal scripts available, you can now purchase from me, for 5 Prevalia donation coins (each). The charged cost represents the amount of time I have spent writing, testing, and perfecting them. 

| Script | Purpose|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| :hand: Stealing | For your thieves! Lift loot right out of other player's packs. Everyone who has ran this says it works great. 
In fact, I just ran this again at Prevalia bank and walked away with a Tmap! This has been coded to accomodate latest snooping changes as well. One of my favorite boss raid/bank sitter scripts for sure. I will also coach you on how/where to steal. |
| :moyai: Recall Miner  | Its back!! The insanely successful recall miner (this isnt just a single spot mining btw). I also send you a guide on how to mark spots. Made insane amounts of ingots for my friends and myself with this one.  Ran this myself or a week straight, next week I made a 120 Blacksmith and 120 Tinker. Sick ingots and near-PK proof to boot. I love this one. |
| :evergreen_tree: Recall Lumberjack  | Hands down, the script I am *most* proud of and the one I have only shared with the closest friends. Everyone which has tried it had one word to describe it - 'amazing'  |
| :ship: Pirate Scripts  | You get (3) of my pirate scripts which automate popular builds. These taunt, throw explodes, heal your crew, cure, drink heal pots, and so much more. Only shared with my close pirate buddies, who love them! I run 3 accounts on a ship all automated, I barely have to do anything but fire the cannons and move around! |
| :moneybag: Vendor Scam | Check every item (drops, scrolls, bags, chests) on a vendor to see if somebody accidentally priced it at 999! Run at vendor malls ~ this is a fun one.|

By purchasing a script from me, you get:
* My (instant) response any time I am on to help you with them.
* My help customizing it to your needs and any time you require to get it going.
* Full refund of donation coins if you simply don't like it.

Why sell them? 
* They took an immense amount time to create and test. Time I could have spent in game in farming. If I give them away, then its a double whammie - not only have I missed farming, but I've given you scripts to compete with my ability to sell ingots/lumber. See? Asking for a few donation coins offsets this risk and lost time/revenue.
