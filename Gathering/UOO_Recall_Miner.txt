// UO Steam Recall Miner
// for Outlands
// by Jewele
//
// Recall miner which recalls you to each location in a runebook,
// and walks Northwest about 30 spaces, mining at every 2 paces.
//
// What does this do for you:
// --------------------------
// * Recalls to 15 spots in each runebook you add
// * At each location mines multiple spots
// * Carries few regs and 1 pick at a time to 
//   minimize loss from PKs
// * Audible alarms for miner damage, and captcha
// * Works at bank or home
// * Only recalls you back when overweight
// * Recalls you away from PKs detected in Tracking
// * Recalls you away from Blues who are near you
// * Auto unloads when you are full
// * Auto unloads seeds
// * Heals you if you are damaged and plays alarm
// 
// Character Build:
// ----------------
// 50+ Mining
// 50+ Camping
// 60 Magery
// 100 Tracking
//
// Requirements:
// -------------
// One or more Blessed Runebooks (in pack)
//
// Runebook Preparation:
// ---------------------
// 1) Mark a spot either at your bank
//    or home next to a container of your choice.
// 2) Set the first rune in book as DEFAULT
// 3) Fill rest of runebook with mining locations.
// 4) Repeat for each runebook
//
// How to use?
// -----------
// 1) Decide what container you want to use -
//    either a box/bag in your bank or a chest
//    at your home. This will be known as <box>
// 2) Put picks in <box>
// 3) Put recall and heal regs in <box>
// 4) If you have tracking: * Reds, * Closest, [X] House
// 5) Run script
//
// Bank or home?
// -------------
// This was written for both, actually, so you might see
// your character say "bank" even though you are running
// it from home. If running from home, when prompted for
// the banker, select the box.
//
// Mining Pattern
// --------------
// This script has you walking Northwest, you can adjust
// it to walk whatever pattern you want, as far as you want.
//
// Marking Locations
// -----------------
// Choose spots that allow you to North-West (straight up) about 30 paces.
// Dont worry if you bump into walls, you will follow the wall and keep
// going.
//
// Tracking Window
// ---------------
// After getting frustrated with PKs jumping me, despite tracking closest,
// I decided to add active Tracking alongside passive hunting mode. You will
// see the tracking window appear on your screen. What I found was - it actually
// improves reliability of passive hunting! No explanation why - maybe
// passive hunting processes the results from the active track? 
// No PKs have ever gotten even close to me after I added this /thumbsup.
//
// IMPORTANT : Mix and match your rune locations. Do not put 2 of same
//             location next to each other. You don't want to detect PK
//             and recall back 20 spaces away.
//
//
// Known Issues
// ------------
// Sometimes spams screen with unable to pick up item? strange!
//
// This is 100% designed to collide into walls in mines, thats
// part of its algorithm = dont worry about it.
//
// When marking a home container, use a chest sitting on ground.
// DO NOT USE a box in a box! Must use main chest in game.
//
// Sounds
// ------------
// 1. You can get the buzzer.wav file at :
//    https://github.com/gmccord333/UOOutlands/tree/master/Sounds
// 2. Create a \Sounds directory in UOSteam directory
// 3. Put file in there
//

// 1.1 Added proximity detect on reds
// 1.2 Forgot heal regs, duh...
