// UO Steam Recall Lumberjack
// for Outlands
// by Jewele
//
// Recall lumberjack which recalls you to each location in a runebook,
// and gathers resources in a semi-random pattern around you. Due to 
// it 'exploring' the forest around you, it will not bring in wood
// near as fast as a player directed character. However, its return
// actually is pretty good! I was surprised when I tested it.
//
// What does this do for you:
// --------------------------
// * Recalls to 15 spots in a runebook
// * At each location chops multiple spots
// * Carries few regs and 1 axe
// * Walking pattern is never the same between two spots
// * Audible alarms for miner damage, and captcha
// * Heals you with audible alarm if you take damage
// * Detects nearby PKs and recalls you away
// * Recalls immediately if aggro in range
// * Works at bank or home
// * Drops wood off at 500 logs
// 
// Character Build:
// ----------------
// 50+ Lumberjack
// 60 Magery
// 100 Tracking
//
// Requirements:
// -------------
// One Blessed Runebook (in pack)
//
// Runebook Preparation:
// ---------------------
// 1) Mark first rune in blessed runebook as DEFAULT
// 2) SET THE RUNE DEFAULT - this is not automatic!
// 3) Fill rest of runebook with chopping locations.
//
// How to use?
// -----------
// 1) Decide what container you want to use -
//    either a box/bag in your bank or a chest
//    at your home. This will be known as <box>
// 2) Put axes in <box>
// 3) Put recall and heal regs in <box>
// 4) If you have tracking: * Reds, * Closest, [X] House
// 5) Run script
//
// Bank or home?
// -------------
// This was written for both, actually, so you might see
// your character say "bank" even though you are running
// it from home. If running from home, when prompted for
// the banker, select the box.
//
// Lumber Pattern
// --------------
// The pattern is semi-intelligent - in that, if you go 
// a direction that has wood, it will keep going that direction
// then switch to other compass points when no wood is found.
// This is what makes this a "better" lumberjack macro than
// most I've found - it learns which directions are yielding wood.
//
// Marking Locations
// -----------------
// Choose _sparsely_ wooded areas without much aggro. For example,
// outside Andaria. Examples of places NOT to do this : Nusero island.
// Just mark right in the middle of the forest.
//
// Aggro Avoidance
// ---------------
// Macro will recall you out immediately if it detects any hostile nearby.
// If you get aggro, and its going to happen, where the mob is blocking
// your recall. Just run away from it to another part of the forest, and
// let macro continue. No need to stop!
//
// Tracking Window
// ---------------
// After getting frustrated with PKs jumping me, despite tracking closest,
// I decided to add active Tracking alongside passive hunting mode. You will
// see the tracking window appear on your screen. What I found was - it actually
// improves reliability of passive hunting! No explanation why - maybe
// passive hunting processes the results from the active track? 
// No PKs have ever gotten even close to me after I added this /thumbsup.
//
// IMPORTANT : Mix and match your rune locations. Do not put 2 of same
//             location next to each other. You don't want to detect PK
//             and recall back 20 spaces away.
//
// Known Issues
// ------------
//
// You might see this macro walk you into a house or some other strange place.
// Dont worry it will turn you around or, upon exhausting directions, go to
// next rune spot.
//
// Sounds
// ------------
// 1. You can get the buzzer.wav file at :
//    https://github.com/gmccord333/UOOutlands/tree/master/Sounds
// 2. Create a \Sounds directory in UOSteam directory
// 3. Put file in there
//
// Versions
// -----------
// 1.0 First release! yay!
